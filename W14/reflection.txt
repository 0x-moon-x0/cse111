Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.

I think the moment I first started working with functions I realized just how useful and applicable they are.
Processing files, converting values and other stuff is much easier with functions. 

2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?

Test functions save a lot of time and nerves. They prevent you from running the program 10 times just to find what you did wrong hours later.

3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?

First of all I would probably run it as is, and if there is a problem, I would manually fix it. But if I can't immediately tell what's wrong with my program,
I will run it through a debugger and see what I did wrong. Then, once everything runs fine, I will write a test function to confirm everything is correct (math, usually).

I guess to improve my way of troubleshooting, I would have to write test functions along with the program and run it through pytest first, instead of trying to fix it myself.
